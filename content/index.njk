	<p>
		I am a <span class="highlight-role">postdoctoral researcher</span> at
		<span class="highlight-mila"> Mila - Quebec AI Institute</span>
		and a <span class="highlight-role">postdoctoral fellow</span> at
		<span class="highlight-mcgill">McGill University</span> in Montréal 🇨🇦.
		Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Language Science and
		Technology Department of
		<span class="highlight-saarland">Saarland University</span> in Saarbrücken
		🇩🇪, where I also did my PhD in Computer Science.
	</p>
	<p>
		The overarching goal of my research is to build natural language processing
		(NLP) systems that are
		<span class="highlight-research"
			>well understood, robust, and adaptable</span
		>. 
		Millions of users now interact with NLP models such as ChatGPT on a daily basis. 
		However, despite their impressive capabilities, we lack a fundamental understanding of how and why LLMs work.
		Without this understanding it is difficult to reliably predict their behavior, mitigate biases in their predictions,
		and create trust in current and future NLP systems. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A recurring theme in my research is to <span class="highlight-research">challenge the status quo</span> and critically question our
		understanding of existing approaches and research practices. For our work, my collaborators and I have received a
		<span class="highlight-award">Best Paper Award 🏆</span> at COLING 2022, the
		<span class="highlight-award">Best Theme Paper Award 🏆</span> at ACL 2023,
		and the <span class="highlight-award">Most Interesting Paper Award 🏆</span> at the
		BabyLM Challenge 2023.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my free time, I enjoy CrossFit 🏋️, playing soccer ⚽️, and occationally
		baking 🍰.
